1. Declare an integer array a[5] to store values.
2. Declare integers low, mid, high, and search to store search-related values.
3. Print "Enter: ".
4. For i from 0 to 4:
    a. Read an integer and store it in a[i].
5. For i from 0 to 4:
    a. For j from 0 to 4:
        i. Swap a[i] and a[j] if a[i] is greater than a[j].

6. Print "Search: ".
7. Read the integer value to be searched and store it in the variable 'search'.
8. Initialize 'low' to 0 and 'high' to 4.

9. While 'low' is less than or equal to 'high', repeat the following steps:
    a. Calculate 'mid' as (low + high) / 2.
    b. If a[mid] is equal to 'search':
        i. Print "Found: " followed by a[mid].
    c. If a[mid] is less than 'search':
        i. Update 'low' to mid + 1.
    d. Otherwise (a[mid] is greater than 'search'):
        i. Update 'high' to mid - 1.

10. Print "Exit."
11. End of the algorithm.
